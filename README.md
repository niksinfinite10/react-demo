description:
I have assumed that the we need to find properties from delemeters.js file's delemeter object.

-> I have created the dummy json which have the delemeters data 
-> In component didMount method it will get the data from the JSON
-> In the input box if you write the correct property name then it will give you the value for that property in each language object.
-> I have made separate component for the SearchResult in which you will pass the search result and it will render the result.
-> If nothing is entered and if you hit the enter you will see no data found message.
